<p align="center">Bank Atm simulation created with React and styled with bootstrap<p>

## Description

The idea is to create an app that simulates the bank Atm. The user has to choose to make a deposit or withdraw money, and everytime an action occured, the account balance is updated. I added a feature also that make any withdraw less than the account balance not availble, and pop up a message to let the user know that the transaction is not possible. For each transaction not possible the submit button is disable.
